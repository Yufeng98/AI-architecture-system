Number formats are the cheapest lever an accelerator has. Halving the width of an operand
roughly halves the storage it occupies, the bandwidth it consumes, and the area of the
multiplier that consumes it — so reduced precision buys more arithmetic per unit of hardware
than almost any other change. The question is what you give up.

![Bit allocation of standard, AI-oriented, block-scaled, and integer formats. For block-scaled formats the shared 8-bit scale is drawn as its amortized per-element cost: 0.25 bit per element for 32-element blocks, 0.5 bit for 16-element blocks. MX and NVFP4 layouts follow the OCP MX specification [@ocpMX2023] and NVIDIA's NVFP4 description [@nvidiaNVFP4Format2025].](figures/precision.svg)

Every format splits its bits between a sign, an **exponent**, and a **mantissa**. Exponent
width sets *dynamic range* — how large and how small a value can be before it overflows or
flushes to zero. Mantissa width sets *precision* — how finely values can be distinguished
within that range. The four families in the figure are four different answers to how those
bits should be spent:

- **Standard IEEE formats** (FP64, FP32) allocate generously on both axes. FP64 spends 11
  exponent bits and 52 mantissa bits; FP32 spends 8 and 23.
- **AI-oriented formats** keep the range and sacrifice the precision. BF16 and TF32 both
  retain FP32's 8-bit exponent, which is what keeps training numerically stable, while cutting
  the mantissa to 7 and 10 bits respectively. FP16 does the opposite trade, keeping 10 mantissa
  bits but dropping to a 5-bit exponent — which is why FP16 training often needs loss scaling
  and BF16 usually does not.
- **Block-scaled formats** (MXFP8, MXFP6, MXFP4, NVFP4) share one 8-bit scale factor across a
  block of values — 32 elements for the MX formats, 16 for NVFP4. The scale costs only a
  fraction of a bit per element once amortized, so a 4-bit element can carry range that a
  standalone 4-bit float could not.
- **Integer formats** (INT8, INT4) drop the exponent entirely and rely on a separate scale
  applied outside the arithmetic.

Two trends run through this. Dynamic range is protected more carefully than precision, because
a value that overflows destroys a training run while a value that is slightly imprecise usually
does not. And scaling is increasingly amortized across groups of values rather than stored per
element, which is what makes 4-bit arithmetic practical at all.

#### 1.2.8 Low-Precision Arithmetic, Structured Sparsity, and Effective Data Bandwidth

Trained networks carry a lot of redundancy. After pruning, many weights can be set to zero with
little accuracy loss, and every zero is both a multiplication you can skip and a byte you do not
have to fetch. The difficulty is that hardware cannot exploit zeros that arrive in arbitrary
positions: irregular access patterns and per-element metadata cost more than the skipped work
saves.

**Structured sparsity** makes the zeros predictable. An `M:N` rule requires that exactly `M` of
every `N` consecutive values be nonzero, so the compressed layout has a fixed shape. That
regularity preserves locality, allows compact storage with cheap metadata, and — crucially —
keeps the datapath regular enough that a matrix engine can still be used [@sparseDNN].

![A 2:4 structured-sparse matrix. Two of every four entries along a row are nonzero, so an R×C matrix compresses to an R×(C/2) array of values plus an R×(C/2) array of 2-bit indices recording where each value came from.](figures/structured-sparsity.svg)

NVIDIA and AMD GPUs implement a fixed 2:4 pattern: two of every four elements must be zero.
Operands are stored compactly alongside lightweight metadata, and when the constraint is met
throughput can roughly double [@A100WhitePaper,sparsity,MI300XWhitePaper]. AWS Neuron generalizes
this to a range of `M:N` patterns — 4:16, 4:12, 4:8, 2:8, 2:4, 1:4 and 1:2 — which lets a model
trade accuracy against throughput at a finer granularity than a single fixed
ratio [@NeuronCorev4].

### 1.4 Processing Elements and Matrix Compute Units

A processing element (PE) is the smallest unit that does arithmetic: a multiplier, an adder,
a little local state, and just enough control to know what to do next. Accelerators differ
enormously at the chip level, but nearly all of them are built by replicating a PE thousands
of times and then deciding how operands reach it.

That decision is where the designs diverge. A general-purpose machine hands every PE its
operands from a centralized register file or SRAM, which is flexible but expensive: the same
value gets read many times over. Systolic arrays take the opposite approach. Activations and
weights are injected at the boundary of the array, and interior PEs receive their operands
from neighbours and pass partial sums onward. This neighbour-to-neighbour reuse replaces a
large fraction of costly memory accesses with short local transfers, which is why systolic
arrays are so common in accelerators that are built primarily for matrix
multiplication [@2023ISCATPUv4].

Not every accelerator has a matrix engine at all. Some rely entirely on SIMD or vector units,
betting on memory bandwidth instead of operand reuse. Cerebras takes this route with an
SRAM-centric wafer-scale design, which sustains near-peak performance even on the
memory-bound BLAS-1 and BLAS-2 operations that fall far short of peak on HBM-based
systems [@cerebras2023]. Processing-in-memory designs from Samsung and SK hynix make a
similar bet, placing vector or SIMD units next to DRAM banks to get very high effective
bandwidth [@AiMJSSCC,Samsungaquabolt].

<sub>Sources: Survey §3.2 and Fig. 5; [NVIDIA][layers-nvidia-gpu] and [AWS Neuron][layers-aws-neuron] layer mappings.</sub>

On-chip SRAM is the same circuit everywhere; what differs is *who decides what lives in it*.
That choice runs along a spectrum, from caches where the hardware decides implicitly to
scratchpads where software decides explicitly. The trade is programmability and compiler
simplicity on one end against performance predictability and quality of service on the other.

![Hardware-managed cache and software-managed on-chip SRAM across CPUs, GPUs, and domain-specific accelerators. Blue denotes caches, orange denotes scratchpads, grey denotes compute.](figures/memory-hierarchy.svg)

**CPUs sit at the hardware-managed end.** Multi-level caches decide placement, replacement and
coherence on their own, and software gets to pretend it is addressing one flat memory. That is
excellent for generality — irregular and data-dependent access patterns are handled without any
special effort — but it makes performance hard to reason about, because whether an access hits
or misses depends on dynamic execution behaviour you cannot see.

Fully hardware-managed caches have not disappeared from AI accelerators. Intel's Gaudi 3 uses
configurable SRAM that can act as one globally shared L3 or as per-core L2 caches, and adds
semantics-aware caching on top: a Memory Context ID tags cache lines by how the algorithm uses
them, and allocation hints let a developer say whether data belongs in L2, L3, or both.

**GPUs and domain-specific accelerators expose part of the SRAM directly.** In an NVIDIA GPU the
SRAM inside each streaming multiprocessor is partitioned between a hardware-managed L1 cache and
a software-managed *shared memory*. A CUDA programmer allocates shared memory explicitly for
tiling, while still letting the L1 and L2 caches handle the accesses that hardware serves better.
Blackwell extends this further with a dedicated **tensor memory** in each SM, reserved for Tensor
Core operands [@blackwell].

Explicit scratchpads move real work onto the programmer and the compiler: tile sizing, double
buffering, prefetch scheduling and synchronization all become part of the performance contract.
What you get back is determinism. Data placement and movement are predictable, which is what
makes tail latency, interference isolation and quality-of-service guarantees achievable. AWS
NeuronCore is built around this compiler-managed locality model [@NeuronCorev4].

Increasingly, this management extends past the chip. NVSHMEM gives GPUs a distributed
shared-memory abstraction: each GPU keeps its own memory, but a symmetric region is exposed on
every device so kernels can read, write and perform atomics on remote GPU memory over NVLink,
PCIe or InfiniBand [@nvshmem]. Groq pushes the idea across the network, backing a logically
shared global address space with distributed on-chip SRAM. Rather than congestion-aware flow
control, it uses software-scheduled networking, where the compiler resolves contention and
schedules fine-grained transfers on each link — about 2.5% metadata overhead in exchange for
communication behaviour that is highly deterministic [@Groq2022software].

### 1.15 Evolution of Matrix-Engine Datapaths and Control Granularity

<sub>Sources: Survey §5.2, Figs. 13–14; [NVIDIA layer mapping][layers-nvidia-gpu].</sub>

Matrix engines got faster far more quickly than the machinery that feeds them, and five
generations of NVIDIA Tensor Cores are a good way to watch what that pressure did to a design.
Two things changed in parallel. The **data path** moved from ordinary per-thread `ld`
instructions to warp-level `wmma.load`, then to the more flexible `ldmatrix`, and finally to
asynchronous transfers that overlap movement with computation. The **control granularity** — how
many threads cooperate to issue one matrix operation — widened from an 8-thread sub-warp group to
a full 32-thread warp, then to a 4-warp warp group, and finally across multiple streaming
multiprocessors.

![Tensor Core control-flow evolution across NVIDIA GPU architectures: an 8-thread sub-warp in Volta, a 32-thread warp in Turing and Ampere, a 4-warp group in Hopper, and a thread-block pair spanning two SMs in Blackwell.](figures/gpu-control-flow.svg)

Read the two trends together and the logic is clear: as each matrix operation got larger, it
became wasteful for a small group of threads to own it, and it became impossible to keep the
engine busy with synchronous, finely addressed copies.

#### 1.15.1 Volta: Warp-Cooperative Programming Interface and Sub-Warp Machine Execution

The first-generation Tensor Cores are presented to the programmer as warp-cooperative, but the
machine executes them at a finer granularity: each 32-thread warp issues as four 8-thread
`quadpair` micro-operations [@CuTeMMA]. Volta also introduced `wmma.load`, which feeds the engine
by loading N×128 bytes from shared memory into registers — a large, rigid transfer unit.

#### 1.15.2 Turing: Warp-Level MMA, ldmatrix, and Operand Layout

Turing moved instruction issue from the 8-thread `quadpair` up to the full warp, spreading operand
fragments across all 32 lanes [@yan2020demystifying]. It also added `ldmatrix`, where a group of
four threads loads 16 consecutive bytes. That sits between the two earlier extremes: more
efficient than per-thread 4-byte `ld`, more flexible than `wmma.load`'s fixed 128-byte granularity.

The flexibility is the point. Because `ldmatrix` does not dictate a single layout, kernels can
permute shared memory — CUTLASS-style swizzles, for instance — to avoid bank conflicts. Replacing
a baseline matrix multiply-accumulate kernel with a permuted shared-memory layout enabled by
`ldmatrix` has been measured at up to 3× faster than the `wmma.load` version [@sun2022dissecting].

#### 1.15.3 Ampere: cp.async and Global-to-Shared Data Movement

Once Tensor Core throughput rose far enough, shared-memory tiling alone stopped being sufficient:
moving the next tile from global to shared memory serialized against computing on the current one.
Ampere's `cp.async` turns operand movement into a software pipeline. While the Tensor Cores work
on tiles already resident in shared memory, later tiles are prefetched asynchronously from global
memory.

![Synchronous versus asynchronous data paths. The upper pipeline repeats global access, shared-memory staging, and compute in sequence; the lower pipeline staggers iterations so the next tile's transfer overlaps the current tile's computation.](figures/gpu-data-path.svg)

The effect is less synchronization overhead and genuine overlap between compute and data movement:
an asynchronous matrix multiply-accumulate kernel runs about 2× faster than the synchronous
baseline [@sun2022dissecting].

#### 1.15.4 Hopper: WGMMA, TMA, and Distributed Shared Memory

Hopper widens the control scope and deepens the pipeline. `WGMMA` expands the unit of issue from a
single warp to a **warp group** of typically four warps. This addresses a measured ceiling:
microbenchmarking reports warp-level MMA on Hopper plateauing near 63% of peak without
warp-group-level pipelining [@luo2024benchmarking].

On the operand-delivery side, the **Tensor Memory Accelerator** (TMA) takes over bulk
global-to-shared transfers along with the address generation and loop overhead they carry. Instead
of many threads cooperatively issuing fine-grained copies with explicit per-thread addressing, a
single designated warp lane enqueues one descriptor-driven asynchronous tensor transfer. In a GEMM
microbenchmark with M=128, N=4096 and K=4096, swapping Ampere-style `cp.async` staging for TMA
raised profiled global-memory throughput from roughly 910 GB/s to 1.45 TB/s — a 59% increase in
that kernel [@HopperTMA].

Hopper also adds distributed shared memory within an SM cluster, so SMs can exchange data directly
instead of going through global memory. Measured SM-to-SM latency is about 180 cycles against
roughly 265 cycles via L2, a reduction of about 32% [@luo2024benchmarking].

#### 1.15.5 Blackwell: Tensor Memory and Paired-SM Tensor Execution

Blackwell centres the datapath on the Tensor Cores by giving each SM 256 KB of dedicated **Tensor
Memory** (TMEM) to hold intermediate operands. In back-to-back FP8 GEMM experiments TMEM sustains
roughly 8 TB/s, about 2.1× the roughly 3.8 TB/s ceiling of `ld.global`-dominated
paths [@jarmusch2025microbenchmarking].

It also pushes the cooperation boundary past a single SM. Under **SM-pair execution**, two adjacent
thread blocks are co-scheduled within an SM cluster to jointly execute one larger matrix
multiply-accumulate operation. Sharing operands across SMs cuts redundant control overhead and
raises utilization — the same trajectory Hopper started, with wider cooperation and more
asynchronous, more specialized data paths used to keep a rapidly growing matrix engine fed.

### 4.2 AI Datacenter Context and Four Categories of Resource Pressure

<sub>Sources: Survey §2 and Figs. 1–3.</sub>

Progress in AI has stopped being only an algorithms story. Nearly 90% of notable AI models in
2024 came from industry, up from 60% in 2023, and the training compute behind frontier models
has been doubling roughly every five months [@stanford2025aiindex]; one estimate puts the growth
at about 5× per year since 2020 [@epoch2025trends]. Capability is now coupled to whether an
organization can provision and operate large infrastructure, not to single-processor speed.

That demand has made energy a first-order architectural constraint rather than a facilities
detail. The International Energy Agency puts global datacenter electricity use at roughly
415 TWh in 2024 and projects it could more than double to about 945 TWh by 2030, with AI a major
driver [@iea2025energyai]. In the United States, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory reports
datacenters at about 4.4% of total electricity consumption in 2023, projected to reach
6.7–12% by 2028 [@shehabi2025lbnl].

The deeper problem is not that any one resource is scarce — it is that the resources are growing
at very different rates.

![Normalized scaling of frontier-model parameter count, per-accelerator dense FP16/BF16 compute, HBM bandwidth and capacity, and per-GPU bidirectional NVLink bandwidth. Each series is normalized to its first observation; the percentages are annualized growth rates between each series' first and last observation.](figures/scaling.png)

Read the growth rates in order and the whole shape of the field falls out. Model parameter counts
grow fastest at roughly 248% per year [@deepseekV4Pro,kimiK3]. Per-accelerator dense FP16/BF16
compute follows at about 73%. HBM bandwidth and capacity trail at roughly 53% and 47%, and
scale-up interconnect bandwidth is slowest at about 36%. So models outgrow compute, and compute
outgrows the memory and communication needed to feed it. Independent analyses of the "memory
wall" report the same trend [@gholami2024memorywall].

This is why an accelerator cannot be judged by its arithmetic throughput. Four pressures —
**compute**, **memory capacity**, **memory and interconnect bandwidth**, and **power** — tighten
at different speeds, and a design that relieves one often intensifies another. Specialized matrix
engines and low-precision arithmetic raise compute efficiency; higher memory bandwidth and greater
on-chip reuse cut trips to external memory; fast interconnects let model state span many devices.
Because each mechanism targets a different bottleneck, architectures differ mainly in which
pressure they chose to relieve first.

![Selected AI accelerators disclosed from 2016 to 2026, by vendor.](figures/accelerator-timeline.svg)

Alongside continued GPU development, cloud and platform providers began building accelerators for
the services they operate. Google disclosed its TPU in 2016 [@googleTPUIntroduction2016], AWS
announced Inferentia in 2018 [@awsInferentiaIntroduction2018], and Meta and Microsoft introduced
MTIA and Maia in 2023 [@MTIA,microsoftMaiaIntroduction2023].

These accelerators encode different objectives. NVIDIA and AMD datacenter GPUs are programmable
platforms spanning a broad range of training and inference work, pairing specialized matrix
computation with general-purpose parallel execution [@A100WhitePaper,amdMI300XPaper]. In-house
accelerators are usually tailored to their owner's own models, service requirements and cost
structure. AWS built Inferentia to cut inference cost at high throughput and low latency, then
Trainium for training [@awsInferentiaIntroduction2018,awsTrainiumIntroduction2020]. Google's first
TPU targeted inference, with v2 and v3 extending the family to training [@TPUv2v3]; more recently
TPU 8t emphasizes large-scale pre-training while TPU 8i targets post-training and latency-sensitive
serving [@tpuv8].

Workloads shift across generations too. Meta's MTIA 100 and 200 focused on ranking and
recommendation inference [@MTIA,MTIA2]; MTIA 300 extends to recommendation training and MTIA 400
broadens to generative AI while keeping recommendation [@metaMTIAEvolution2026]. Microsoft's Maia
100 arrived for cloud AI training and inference, whereas Maia 200 targets the cost of token
generation during inference [@microsoftMaiaIntroduction2023,microsoftMaia200Introduction2026].

### 4.3 Core Taxonomy: Four Classes of AI Accelerator Architecture

<sub>Sources: Survey §3, Table 1 and Fig. 4.</sub>

Specialized accelerators deliver substantially more throughput and better energy efficiency than
general-purpose CPUs on AI workloads, but they do not all get there the same way. Four categories
cover the dominant designs, separated by their **primary execution and data-movement model** — not
by vendor, and not by which operations they happen to support.

Table: **High-level taxonomy of AI accelerator architectures.**

| Category | Computer architecture | Representative platforms |
|---|---|---|
| **GPU** | General-purpose SIMT architecture with dedicated tensor/matrix units | NVIDIA GPU, AMD GPU |
| **NPU** | Heterogeneous domain-specific architecture combining matrix, vector and scalar engines around a shared on-chip scratchpad | Google TPU, AWS Trainium/Inferentia, Qualcomm Cloud AI, Huawei Ascend, Intel Gaudi, Microsoft Maia, Cambricon MLU |
| **Spatial dataflow** | Computation graph mapped onto distributed compute, memory and communication resources, in three styles: PE array, reconfigurable fabric, functional-slice streaming | *PE array:* Tenstorrent, Meta MTIA, Tesla Dojo, Graphcore IPU, Cerebras; *reconfigurable:* SambaNova; *functional-slice:* Groq |
| **Compute-in-memory** | Memory-centric architecture integrating compute logic in or near SRAM or DRAM to reduce data movement | d-Matrix, SK hynix AiM, Samsung PIM |

![Architectural categories of AI accelerators. (a) GPU: SIMT cores with tensor units over a hybrid hierarchy of shared memory and caches. (b) NPU: matrix, vector, scalar and special-function engines around a shared scratchpad. (c) Spatial dataflow, in three substyles: PE array, reconfigurable fabric, and functional-slice streaming. (d) Compute-in-memory: arithmetic inside memory arrays or in logic tightly coupled to banks. Green denotes compute, blue denotes memory.](figures/accelerator-architecture.svg)

Each category exploits a different property of AI workloads: increasing data reuse, specializing
compute resources, or improving data locality. Designs in the same category still differ in
supported operations, memory organization, and how much of the chip stays general-purpose. GPUs
keep SIMT cores beside their matrix units; NPUs such as Google TPU and AWS NeuronCore pair
specialized matrix engines with vector, scalar or SIMD
execution [@nvidiaH100Paper,amdMI300XPaper,2023ISCATPUv4,NeuronCorev2]. Memory systems mix the
same way, combining hardware-managed caching with software-managed storage for explicit reuse.

So the useful question is not what an accelerator is called. It is **which computations and which
data movements receive dedicated hardware support, and which are left to general-purpose hardware or
to software**. Each platform below is assigned a primary category by its dominant execution and
data-movement model, while acknowledging that secondary mechanisms — systolic execution,
compiler-managed placement, near-memory arithmetic — cut across categories.

Table: **Key architectural features of representative AI accelerators.** Scale-up topologies refer to representative platforms rather than to the chip alone.

<sub>Sources: Survey §3 and §3.1; additional GPU records are extensions, not additional survey case studies.</sub>

GPUs keep the **SIMT** (single-instruction, multiple-thread) execution model that made them
broadly programmable, and add tensor or matrix cores for the dense linear algebra that dominates
modern AI [@nvidiaH100Paper,nvidiaRubin2026,amdMI300XPaper,amdMI455X2026,amdCDNA5]. That
combination is the category's defining trait: nothing is given up in generality, and specialized
throughput is layered on top.

Both NVIDIA and AMD use HBM to supply their high-throughput compute units. Scale-up topology,
though, is a property of the *platform* rather than the chip: NVIDIA systems have used several
different NVLink organizations across generations, including both direct-connect and switched
fabrics [@nvidiaHGX2Topology], and AMD deployments range from directly connected GPU baseboards to
the switched UALoE fabric of the MI455X-based Helios rack. This is why topology is always reported
together with a system configuration rather than a part number.

Programmability, high-bandwidth memory and fast scale-up communication together are what let GPUs

### 4.5 NPU: Heterogeneous Compute Engines and Shared Local Memory

<sub>Sources: Survey §3 and Table 2; the final two entries broaden the case pool using additional platform records.</sub>

NPUs answer the same demand with explicit heterogeneity. Representative designs include Google
TPU [@tpuArch,2023ISCATPUv4,tpuv5p,tpuv5e,tpuv6e,tpuv7,tpuv8], AWS
Trainium [@AWSTrainuim,AWSTrainuim2,AWSTrainuim3], Qualcomm Cloud AI 100 [@qualcommAI100], Huawei
Ascend [@HuaweiAscend,liao2025ub], Intel Gaudi [@IntelGaudi3HC36], Microsoft
Maia [@MicrosoftMaia] and Cambricon MLU [@cambriconBangCGuide].

Rather than one flexible core type, an NPU integrates several specialized ones and maps each kind
of operator onto the block built for it: **matrix engines** for GEMM-intensive computation,
**vector units** for activations and normalization, **scalar units** for control-oriented work.
When operators map cleanly and the engines stay busy, this improves area and energy efficiency;
when they do not, some engines sit idle. That conditional is the central trade of the category.

Some NPUs replicate a complete matrix–vector–scalar core and scale out across several of them.
The Cambricon MLU is grouped here rather than with spatial dataflow for exactly this reason: it
exposes a multi-core neural-processor ISA and runtime, not a tile-placement programming model.

Many NPUs use **systolic arrays** as their matrix engines. Instead of every processing element
fetching operands from a central register file or SRAM, activation and weight streams are injected
at the array boundary; interior elements take operands from their neighbours and propagate partial
sums onward. Replacing most memory accesses with local neighbour-to-neighbour transfers cuts
memory-bandwidth demand and saves energy. Google's TPUs pair systolic arrays for GEMM with
SparseCores for the embedding operations in recommendation models [@2023ISCATPUv4]; others add
programmable SIMD units for generality, as in the second-generation AWS NeuronCore [@NeuronCorev2].

Scale-up topologies across this category are unusually diverse — 2D and 3D torus, Boardfly, nD
full mesh, direct full mesh, switched Ethernet and switched all-to-all all appear.

### 4.6 Spatial Dataflow I: PE Arrays and Distributed Local Memory

<sub>Sources: Survey §3, Fig. 4(c) and Table 2; additional PE-array and manycore cases follow the platform labels.</sub>

Spatial dataflow architectures map a computation graph directly onto distributed compute, memory
and communication resources. Operator placement, local memory allocation and inter-operator data
movement are all **explicitly managed by the compiler** and exposed to software, instead of being
hidden behind caches or a centralized command stream. Controlling data movement explicitly cuts
coordination overhead and memory traffic and improves locality — at the cost of requiring a
compiler that can actually solve the placement problem.

**PE array** designs divide the chip into many programmable processing elements, each with private
SRAM, connected by an on-chip network. The compiler spreads computation across them and schedules
the transfers between them, so different elements can run different operators or different
pipeline stages. Examples include Tenstorrent [@vasiljevic2024blackhole], Meta
MTIA [@MTIA2], Tesla Dojo [@TeslaDojo] and Graphcore [@dissectingGraphcore]. These systems support
a wider range of memory technologies than GPUs and NPUs — GDDR6, LPDDR, DDR4 and HBM all appear.

Cerebras extends the approach to a wafer-scale mesh [@cerebras2023]. Rather than following
program-counter order, it uses a data-driven execution model: fabric packets called *wavelets*
carry both data and control information, and the arrival of a wavelet activates the corresponding
task on a processing element. Execution is therefore driven by data availability rather than by a
fixed instruction sequence.

### 4.7 Spatial Dataflow II: Reconfigurable Architectures

<sub>Sources: Survey §3 and §6.5; [SambaNova layer mapping][layers-sambanova]. SN40L-era software is a historical case, not a current SDK setup guide.</sub>

Not every spatial dataflow design replicates general-purpose processing elements. **Reconfigurable**
architectures such as SambaNova instead provide configurable compute, memory and interconnect
tiles, and the compiler maps operators and their data dependencies directly onto that
fabric [@ISCA2024sambanova].

The distinction matters for how a design ages. In SambaNova's SN40L the compiler maps supported
model graphs onto configurable tiles and programs the data routes between them, so reconfigurability
buys flexibility as algorithms evolve — but only within a finite set of physical resources and
supported operations [@ISCA2024sambanova].

### 4.8 Spatial Dataflow III: Functional-Slice Streaming

<sub>Sources: Survey §3 and §3.2; [Groq layer mapping][layers-groq] and the Etched dossier. Topology remains generation-specific.</sub>

**Functional-slice streaming** processors, such as Groq, organize the chip into fixed functional
units — matrix engines, vector engines, SRAM blocks and switches — and move data through them on a
schedule the compiler decides in advance [@Groq2020TSP,Groq2022software].

The design deliberately removes the sources of timing variability that other architectures rely on.
There are no caches to miss, no speculation, and no dynamic arbitration; instead the timing of
computation and data movement is exposed to the compiler, which makes execution predictable. Groq
extends the same principle to the network with software-scheduled networking, where the compiler
resolves contention and forbids hardware backpressure, scheduling fine-grained transfers on each
link for about 2.5% metadata overhead [@Groq2022software]. Predictability is the product here, and
it is bought by moving nearly every scheduling decision to compile time.

### 4.9 Compute-in-Memory: SRAM, DRAM, and the Location of Computation

<sub>Sources: Survey §3, §3.2 and §6.2; additional platform records extend the case pool beyond the three surveyed CIM families.</sub>

The fourth category attacks the memory bottleneck at its source by putting arithmetic where the
data already is. Representative designs include d-Matrix [@dMatrixcorsair], SK hynix
AiM [@AiMJSSCC] and Samsung PIM [@Samsungaquabolt], using digital in-SRAM MAC arrays or MAC-based
and SIMD processing-in-memory units.

The motivating observation is that many AI workloads are limited not by arithmetic throughput but
by the energy and latency of moving weights and activations between memory and compute. SRAM-based
compute-in-memory augments bit cells and peripheral circuitry to compute inside the
array [@dMatrixcorsair]. DRAM-based near- and in-memory processing places vector or SIMD units
beside DRAM banks and operates on data in the row buffers, doing bulk computation without crossing
the external memory interface [@AimISSCC,Samsungaquabolt]. Collapsing the usual load–compute–store
sequence into local, highly parallel operations exploits the internal bandwidth of SRAM arrays and
DRAM banks directly.

Where this pays off is specific. Compute-in-memory suits **bandwidth-bound work with little
temporal reuse**: GEMV and matrix–vector operations at small batch sizes, embedding and projection
layers, and sparse or irregular computation where a systolic array cannot fill its reuse pipeline.
Workloads with high arithmetic intensity, such as large-batch GEMM, are better served by matrix
engines designed to amplify reuse. Architecturally the category offers high internal parallelism
but limited flexibility, and its programmability depends heavily on data layout and compiler
scheduling keeping operands resident.

### 4.10 Compute Engines: Cross-Category Organization and Trade-offs

<sub>Sources: Survey §3.1; platform records provide implementation-specific examples.</sub>

Across all four categories, the choice of compute engine — SIMT processors, programmable SIMD
units, dedicated matrix engines, vector and scalar units — comes down to two questions.

The first is **how much programmability to trade for efficiency**. General-purpose execution units
and flexible schedulers adapt to more workloads; specialized engines deliver more performance per
square millimetre. The second is **what computational intensity the target kernels have** — how
much arithmetic is performed per byte moved across each level of the memory hierarchy. That ratio
determines the right balance between compute throughput and memory bandwidth, and it differs
between training and inference, which is why the same vendor often ships different engine mixes
for each.

GPUs arrived at their present form by accretion. Built originally for graphics, they became highly
parallel multithreaded processors with large compute and bandwidth budgets, which is what made
general-purpose GPU computing and then deep learning practical on them [@krizhevsky2012alexnet].
Early architectures were dominated by SIMT processors; modern ones add dedicated matrix engines
such as NVIDIA's Tensor Cores, reached through specialized PTX instructions and supported by
libraries like cuDNN and cuBLAS and by templated abstractions such as CUTLASS and CuTe. Specialized
functional units handle transcendentals: the B300 doubles exponential throughput over the B200,
reflecting how heavily attention uses those functions [@blackwell].

Some architectures carry no matrix engine at all, relying on SIMD or vector units and very high
memory bandwidth instead. Cerebras sustains near-peak performance even on the memory-bound BLAS-1
and BLAS-2 levels that fall far short of peak on HBM-based systems [@cerebras2023], and the
processing-in-memory designs from Samsung and SK hynix reach high effective bandwidth by placing
compute next to DRAM banks [@AiMJSSCC,Samsungaquabolt].

### 4.11 Memory Hierarchy: From Hardware Cache to Software Scratchpad

<sub>Sources: Survey §3.2 and Fig. 5; memory organization is a comparison axis, not a replacement for the four-category taxonomy.</sub>

On-chip SRAM sits on a spectrum from **implicit, hardware-managed caches** to **explicit,
software-managed scratchpads**. The trade is programmability and compiler simplicity against
performance predictability and quality of service.

![Hardware-managed cache and software-managed on-chip SRAM across CPUs, GPUs and domain-specific accelerators. Blue denotes caches, orange denotes scratchpads, grey denotes compute.](figures/memory-hierarchy.svg)

CPUs anchor the hardware-managed end, using multi-level caches where hardware decides placement,
replacement and coherence and software addresses a flat space. Generality is excellent, especially
for irregular access, but performance analysis is hard because hits, misses and contention all
depend on dynamic behaviour. This approach has not left the datacenter: Intel's Gaudi 3 uses
configurable SRAM that can serve as a shared L3 or as per-core L2 caches, and adds semantics-aware
caching — a Memory Context ID tags lines by algorithmic usage, and allocation hints let developers
direct data to L2, L3 or both.

GPUs and domain-specific accelerators expose part of the SRAM instead. NVIDIA partitions each
streaming multiprocessor's SRAM between a hardware-managed L1 and software-managed shared memory,
so a programmer can orchestrate tiling explicitly while leaving other access patterns to the
caches; Blackwell adds a dedicated tensor memory per SM for Tensor Core operands [@blackwell].
Scratchpads shift tile sizing, double buffering, prefetch scheduling and synchronization onto the
compiler and programmer, and return determinism — the property that makes predictable tail latency,
interference isolation and quality-of-service guarantees achievable. AWS NeuronCore is built around
this compiler-managed locality model [@NeuronCorev4].

Memory management is also moving past the chip boundary. NVSHMEM exposes a symmetric memory region
on every GPU so kernels can read, write and perform atomics on remote GPU memory over NVLink, PCIe
or InfiniBand [@nvshmem], and Groq backs a logically shared global address space with distributed
on-chip SRAM across devices [@Groq2022software].

Compute-in-memory is the complementary extreme, performing simple arithmetic where the data resides
rather than staging it into separate arrays — most effective for bandwidth-bound operations with
limited reuse, least effective where a matrix engine could have amplified that reuse instead.

Large-model execution engages every physical level of a datacenter at once, so it helps to have the
levels straight before reasoning about any of them.

![Architecture of datacenter, pod, rack and server. Power plants feed the grid and the distribution units supplying each pod. Within a pod, spine switches connect leaf switches above racks. A rack holds servers attached to a top-of-rack switch. Within a server, accelerators connect to a scale-up fabric and to network interface cards on the scale-out fabric.](figures/datacenter-architecture.svg)

At the **server** level, accelerators are integrated with local communication resources. **Racks**
and **pods** aggregate servers into progressively larger systems, and **datacenter** infrastructure
supplies power delivery and thermal management. Computation and model state are distributed across
devices, partitions exchange data over the interconnect fabrics, and facility-level power and
cooling cap how much of the installed hardware can run at once.

The critical point for an architect is that **these physical levels are not communication
boundaries**. A scale-up fabric may span multiple servers, multiple racks, or an entire pod. Two
distinct ideas are therefore in play:

- A **scale-up fabric** tightly couples a group of accelerators — within a server, a rack or a pod —
  and is engineered for very high bandwidth and low latency.
- A **scale-out network**, usually Ethernet or InfiniBand, connects those groups across the broader
  cluster.

Because collective communication and model-parallel data movement are usually limited by
intra-cluster efficiency, the scale-up fabric has a first-order effect on end-to-end training and
inference performance. Typical tiers run from 4–8 accelerators at node scale, to 64–256 at rack
scale, to 256–1024 at pod scale, with announced pod designs extending to 6K or
8K accelerators [@dighe2026maia200,liao2025ub].

![Node-scale interconnect organizations. (a) PCIe-switched attachment behind a host/root complex. (b) An eight-accelerator physical complete graph. (c) A dedicated switched fabric providing logical any-to-any reachability.](figures/interconnect-node.svg)

The baseline design uses one or more **PCIe switches** to give CPUs, accelerators, NICs and
peripherals packet-switched any-to-any connectivity. It is standards-based, flexible and easy to
integrate, but its bandwidth lags purpose-built accelerator fabrics: even PCIe 6.0 delivers only
about 128 GB/s per direction on a ×16 link, which becomes a bottleneck for workloads dominated by
collectives such as AllReduce, ReduceScatter and AllGather.

**Direct all-to-all** topologies remove the switch entirely and wire accelerators to each other.
Intel's Gaudi 3 is an explicit eight-accelerator direct all-to-all fabric [@IntelGaudi3HC36], and
AMD Instinct platforms use dense direct Infinity Fabric connectivity across eight
GPUs [@amdMI300XPaper]. Single-hop communication gives very high local bandwidth, but wiring and
packaging complexity grows quickly with system size — the link count rises quadratically with
endpoints.

**Switched fabrics** dedicated to scale-up traffic recover that scalability. The NVIDIA HGX H100
platform uses four NVSwitch chips to fully interconnect eight GPUs [@nvswitch], and successive
NVLink generations have continued to raise per-GPU fabric bandwidth.

![Rack-scale interconnect organizations. (a) A switched rack fabric, illustrated by the NVL72 organization. (b) A generic 4×4×4 3D torus with wraparound links. (c) A Dragonfly hierarchy with local and global router links.](figures/interconnect-rack.svg)

Switch-based any-to-any interconnects extend from the node to the rack. The NVL72 rack integrates
72 GPUs and 18 NVSwitches as 18 GPU trays of four GPUs and nine switch trays of two switches. AWS
Trainium 3 follows the same direction with NeuronSwitch-v1, providing an all-to-all fabric across
Trn3 UltraServers of either 64 or 144 chips [@AWSTrn3]. Against direct-connect designs, switching
scales to larger local domains and simplifies board wiring, at the price of switch silicon, power
and packaging.

Any-to-any connectivity requires link or switch resources to grow with the system, so many
architectures instead **bound the per-accelerator degree and accept a larger network diameter**.
The torus is the representative case. AWS Trn1 uses a 2D torus within one instance [@AWSTrn1];
Trn2 keeps a 2D torus within each 16-chip instance and joins four instances into a 64-chip
UltraServer with extra ring links [@AWSTrn2]. Google TPU v4 uses three-dimensional
nearest-neighbour connectivity and can be configured as a 3D torus, with four TPUs per node and 64
TPUs per rack in a 4×4×4 arrangement; full pods add optical circuit switches for bandwidth,
flexibility and energy efficiency [@2023ISCATPUv4].

**Hierarchical high-radix** topologies such as Dragonfly take a third path: group endpoints with
dense local connectivity and connect groups through a limited number of global links, reducing
network diameter without paying for a full mesh. Groq's earlier rack-scale work describes
Dragonfly-based expansion [@Groq2022software]. NVIDIA separately describes the 256-LPU Groq 3 LPX
rack as using direct chip-to-chip links within trays and a chip-to-chip spine across trays, without
identifying that rack as Dragonfly [@NVIDIA-groq-3].

![Pod-scale interconnect organizations. (a) The announced Boardfly hierarchy. (b) The proposed UB-Mesh hierarchy. (c) The Maia 200 hierarchy combining local fully connected quads with Ethernet switching.](figures/interconnect-pod.svg)

At pod scale the designs get deeper rather than wider. Google's forthcoming TPU 8i introduces
**Boardfly**, a Dragonfly-inspired topology that aggregates four-chip building blocks into
eight-board groups and interconnects 36 such groups through optical circuit switches [@tpuv8].

Huawei's **UB-Mesh** proposes a hierarchically localized nD-FullMesh on a unified bus and protocol
stack; its published pod design realizes a 4D full mesh by composing full-mesh connectivity within
and across racks, supported by dedicated low-radix and high-radix switches [@liao2025ub].
Microsoft **Maia** takes an Ethernet-based route: a two-tier topology whose first tier is a
switchless fully connected quad of four directly connected accelerators, with the second tier using
Ethernet switches to extend the scale-up domain across racks to as many as 6,144
accelerators [@MicrosoftMaia,dighe2026maia200].

### 4.20 Topology Performance: Connectivity Is Not Effective Communication Performance

<sub>Sources: Survey §4 and §6.3; network-analysis foundations retained from the original outline.</sub>

Putting the three tiers side by side, each topology choice trades the same four quantities —
bandwidth, latency, scalability and implementation cost — against each other differently:

- **PCIe switching** is the broadly supported baseline, but surveyed deployments generally give
  lower per-accelerator bandwidth than purpose-built scale-up fabrics.
- **Direct full meshes** give single-hop communication, but link count grows quadratically with the
  number of endpoints.
- **Switched any-to-any fabrics** accommodate concurrent collectives and irregular traffic, provided
  switch capacity, routing and endpoint injection bandwidth all suffice — at the cost of switch
  power and packaging complexity.
- **Tori** keep node degree bounded as the system grows, but their larger diameter can raise
  communication latency.
- **Dragonfly- and Boardfly-like hierarchies** shorten paths without full-mesh connectivity at
  system scale, while UB-Mesh and Ethernet-switched designs add further tiers of local and global
  connectivity.

The reason this section exists as its own topic is that none of these properties is a performance
number. A topology defines the paths, the locality hierarchy and the contention domains that are
*available*; what a workload actually achieves depends on how its communication is scheduled onto
them. Topology is therefore co-designed across node, rack and pod scales rather than chosen once.

### 4.21 Collective Semantics: Endpoint Data Transformation

<sub>Sources: Survey §4.4 and Fig. 9: collective endpoint semantics.</sub>

A **collective operation** specifies an endpoint data transformation: what each participant ends up
holding. It says nothing about the route, the schedule or the topology used to get there. Keeping
that separation straight is the key to reasoning about distributed performance, so the semantics
come first and the algorithms follow separately.

![Endpoint semantics of four common collectives for ranks R0–R3. (a) AllReduce returns the elementwise reduction of all inputs to every rank. (b) AllGather concatenates the rank-local shards at every rank. (c) ReduceScatter reduces all inputs and retains one result shard per rank. (d) All-to-All sends a distinct destination chunk to each rank. The panels describe data transformations, not routes, algorithms or physical topologies.](figures/collective-communications.svg)

- **AllReduce** combines corresponding elements from every rank and returns the complete reduced
  tensor to every rank.
- **AllGather** collects rank-local shards and returns their ordered concatenation to every rank.
- **ReduceScatter** reduces corresponding elements, then leaves rank *i* holding only shard *i* of
  the result.
- **All-to-All** transposes rank-specific chunks: every rank sends a distinct chunk to every peer
  and receives one chunk from each source [@nvidiaNCCLCollectives].

ReduceScatter followed by AllGather can implement AllReduce, but that decomposition is an
*algorithmic choice*, not the definition of AllReduce.

These operations map onto distinct roles in a training stack. Replicated data parallelism uses
AllReduce to aggregate gradients. Fully sharded data parallelism and ZeRO-style training use
AllGather to materialize parameter shards before computation and ReduceScatter to aggregate
gradients while preserving sharding [@rajbhandari2020zero]. Tensor and sequence parallelism combine
AllReduce, AllGather and ReduceScatter to exchange partial activations or tensor
slices [@shoeybi2019megatron,korthikanti2023sequence]. Expert-parallel mixture-of-experts models use
All-to-All to dispatch tokens to experts and again to return their outputs [@lepikhin2021gshard].

### 4.22 Collective Algorithms: Logical Communication Scheduling

<sub>Sources: Survey §4.4: collective algorithms and their communication costs.</sub>

The operation fixes the required data movement; the **algorithm** chooses the schedule. Which
schedule wins depends mostly on message size and group size.

For large reduction payloads over relatively uniform links, a **ring** is often attractive: it
partitions the tensor and pipelines ReduceScatter and AllGather around a logical cycle, approaching
bandwidth-optimal per-rank traffic [@patarasuk2009ring]. The cost is a number of startup stages
linear in the rank count, so latency dominates for small messages or very large groups.

**Tree** algorithms cut the dependent stages to logarithmic depth. Double binary trees process
complementary halves of the tensor on two trees, distributing forwarding load while retaining high
aggregate bandwidth under a suitable mapping, which makes them effective for latency-sensitive and
medium-sized reductions at scale [@jeaugey2019nccltrees]. A ring or tree is a *logical* schedule and
need not match the physical wiring literally.

Several families fill the space between. Recursive halving for ReduceScatter followed by recursive
doubling for AllGather — a Rabenseifner-style AllReduce — uses logarithmic rounds and works well
when the fabric sustains concurrent partner exchanges. Bruck-style schedules similarly cut startup
rounds for small AllGather and All-to-All messages, whereas pairwise exchange is usually preferable
for bandwidth-dominated All-to-All traffic [@thakur2005mpich]. Parallel Aggregated Trees extend
logarithmic-step AllGather and ReduceScatter to arbitrary rank counts while limiting long-distance
transfers [@jeaugey2025pat]. For irregular or asymmetric systems, TACCL synthesizes topology-specific
schedules from a hardware model and a communication sketch [@shah2023taccl].

### 4.23 Collective–Topology Mapping and Communication Offload

<sub>Sources: Survey §4.4, especially its topology-mapping and in-network-reduction discussion.</sub>

The physical topology decides which logical schedules can use the available links without
congestion — this is where the previous two topics meet.

Direct and switched any-to-any fabrics can support multiple concurrent rings or trees, and their
direct reachability also suits pairwise All-to-All. On bounded-degree meshes and tori, a runtime can
decompose a collective by dimension, or embed multiple rings, so traffic follows local links and
avoids oversubscribing a cut [@2023ISCATPUv4]. Dragonfly, Boardfly and node–rack–pod fabrics favour
hierarchical local–global–local schedules: reduce or gather within a group, exchange only what must
cross the scarce inter-group links, then distribute within the destination group. The same principle
covers the deeper locality of UB-Mesh and Maia without needing a separate collective semantic per
fabric [@liao2025ub,dighe2026maia200].

Where the fabric can reduce in-network, CollNet- or NVLS-style schedules **offload** the reduction
phases of AllReduce or ReduceScatter — though AllGather and All-to-All still have to move their
distinct data to the destinations [@nvidiaNCCLAlgorithms].

The practical consequence is that there is no universally best collective algorithm. Runtimes select
among rings, trees, recursive exchanges and hierarchical schedules according to the operation,
message size, rank count, topology, link asymmetry and current
contention [@thakur2005mpich,nvidiaNCCLAlgorithms]. Performance depends on the fabric's raw
bandwidth *and* on how well the runtime maps the operation onto its locality, path diversity and
hierarchy.

<sub>Sources: Survey §5, Tables 3–4 and Figs. 11–15; [NVIDIA][chip-nvidia-gpu] and [AMD][chip-amd-gpu] platform records. Preliminary specifications retain that status.</sub>

Tracing one accelerator family across generations separates the features that persist from those
that change — a distinction the architectural taxonomy alone cannot make.

![Per-GPU peak FP32 throughput and dense FP16/BF16 matrix throughput across NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. NVIDIA is drawn with solid lines, AMD with dashed.](figures/fp32-fp16-throughput.svg)

The divergence in that figure is the central fact of the last decade of GPU design. General-purpose
high-precision SIMD throughput (FP32) has grown slowly and remains below 200 TFLOPS, while
low-precision matrix-engine throughput has risen to roughly 2,500 TFLOPS. Each generation's headline
gain comes from the matrix engine and from ever-lower precision, not from the general-purpose
datapath.

Raising matrix throughput, though, is only useful if operands arrive fast enough, so the same
generations also reworked **data supply** and **cooperation scope**. NVIDIA's Tensor Core evolution
includes redesigned operand-delivery mechanisms and tighter coordination among execution units,
enabling greater overlap between data movement and computation and supporting larger matrix
operations [@sun2022dissecting,luo2024benchmarking]. Scheduling mechanisms, data-movement support
and on-chip SRAM capacity all advanced alongside the arithmetic; the microarchitectural detail of
that progression, from Volta through Blackwell, is traced in §1.15.

Peak-throughput numbers are only comparable if the conventions behind them are stated, so this
comparison fixes them first: the values below are **vendor-reported dense peak** throughput, the
low-precision columns use matrix- or tensor-engine throughput where available, and a fused
multiply-add counts as two operations. A dash means the source does not report the format or the
hardware does not support it. TPU and Neuron FP16/BF16 values are BF16.

Read down the GPU columns and the pattern from §4.24 repeats numerically: FP64 and FP32 creep
upward while FP16 matrix throughput multiplies and entirely new, lower-precision formats — FP8, then
FP4 — appear and immediately dominate the headline figures. The specialized path grows; the
general-purpose one does not.

Structured sparsity is the second lever. Trained networks hold substantial redundancy, so many
weights can be zeroed after pruning with little accuracy loss, cutting both computation and memory
traffic. Fully unstructured sparsity is impractical in hardware because of irregular access and
metadata overhead, so accelerators enforce an `M:N` rule — only `M` of every `N` values nonzero —
which preserves locality, allows compact storage, and keeps the datapath regular enough for a matrix
engine [@sparseDNN]. NVIDIA and AMD GPUs implement a fixed 2:4 pattern with lightweight metadata,
roughly doubling throughput when the constraint
holds [@A100WhitePaper,sparsity,MI300XWhitePaper]; AWS Neuron generalizes to 4:16, 4:12, 4:8, 2:8,
2:4, 1:4 and 1:2 for finer accuracy–throughput control [@NeuronCorev4]. The bit-level layout of
these formats and the 2:4 representation itself are covered in §1.2.

From the earliest to the latest listed NVIDIA and AMD generations, HBM **capacity** grew roughly
13.5–18× and HBM **bandwidth** roughly 23–31×. The two scale for largely independent reasons.
Capacity improves through higher per-stack density — more dies per stack and denser DRAM dies — and
through more stacks per package. Bandwidth improves through higher per-pin signalling rates across
HBM generations and through wider aggregate I/O, mostly from additional stacks. Chiplet-based
packaging supports both by enlarging the effective integration area, making room for more stacks
with their PHYs and controllers.

Because memory has lagged compute, accelerators lean harder on on-chip cache. Through 2025 shared
cache capacity grew about 32× for NVIDIA and 64× for AMD relative to the earliest listed devices —
"shared cache" meaning NVIDIA's L2 and AMD's large last-level cache. Bigger caches improve locality,
amplify reuse and relieve off-chip bandwidth.

![Scaling of per-GPU dense FP16/BF16 matrix throughput, shared-cache capacity, and HBM capacity across NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, 2016–2025. Each vendor and metric is normalized to its first observation.](figures/fp16-memory-scaling.svg)

The gap is unmistakable: throughput grew by roughly 120× and 96× for the two vendors, shared cache
by 32× and 64×, and HBM capacity by only 18× and 9×. Compute growth outruns capacity growth for both.

On the fabric side, interconnect bandwidth has risen steadily while topologies have changed shape.
AWS Trainium illustrates the trade cleanly [@AWSTrainuim,AWSTrainuim2,AWSTrainuim3]: Trn1 and Trn2
connect 16 chips in a 4×4 2D torus, Trn2 UltraServer links four such systems into a 64-chip domain
through inter-instance rings, and Trainium 3 replaces the torus with the switched all-to-all
NeuronSwitch-v1 fabric supporting up to 144 chips. A low-radix torus avoids switch silicon and
scales incrementally, but diameter and contention grow with size; a switched fabric costs ports,
area and power but shortens paths and makes performance less sensitive to placement — which matters
most for communication-intensive collectives such as mixture-of-experts routing.

Switching is not the only alternative to a torus. Google TPU 8i's Boardfly builds a hierarchical
high-radix network from four-chip blocks: eight boards form a fully connected group, and 36 groups
are joined through optical circuit switches, giving 1,152 physical chip positions and up to 1,024
active chips. For the 1,024-chip configuration Google reports a maximum path of seven hops against
16 for the referenced 3D torus, a 56% reduction [@tpuv8]. Shorter paths matter most for
latency-sensitive collectives: during autoregressive decoding, small reductions across
model-parallel shards can be a substantial fraction of per-token execution time.

### 4.28 Power Delivery, Cooling, and Practically Operable Capacity

<sub>Sources: Survey §5.4 and §6.4, including Fig. 16; broader RAS and fault-isolation topics are retained extensions.</sub>

Device power has risen sharply: over the past decade the maximum power of a high-end NVIDIA or AMD
datacenter GPU went from roughly 300 W to beyond 1000 W. Aggregated, that becomes an
energy-infrastructure problem. The IEA estimates datacenters consumed roughly 415 TWh in 2024, about
1.5% of global electricity, and projects nearly double — around 945 TWh — by 2030, growing much
faster than overall demand [@iea_energy_ai_exec,iea_energy_ai_demand].

![(a) Maximum reported NVIDIA accelerator power and cooling approach by product generation; limits depend on product and platform configuration. (b) Annual datacenter electricity consumption, with an IEA projection of 945 TWh in 2030.](figures/power-increase.svg)

Cooling has passed through three paradigms, each one lifting a thermal ceiling that had capped
power. The passively air-cooled dual-slot PCIe form factor held thermal design power near 300 W for
years, stretched recently to 600 W in parts such as the H200 NVL. Planar-mounted modules — NVIDIA's
SXM and OCP's Open Accelerator Module — with large vertical tower heatsinks raised this to 1100 W in
generations like the B300 SXM. Direct liquid cooling removes the bulky heatsinks entirely, letting
rack-scale designs such as NVIDIA GB200 support per-GPU limits up to 1400 W in a much smaller
footprint. That densification has a second benefit: it shortens the copper runs for scale-up
networks like NVLink, improving signal integrity and interconnect latency.

**Sufficient total power does not mean usable power.** At a fixed distribution voltage, more rack
power means more current: a 200 kW rack at 54 V draws roughly 3,700 A. Higher current means higher
resistive loss and more heat, while a thicker conductor costs material and space. NVIDIA identifies
physical limits of 54 VDC distribution beyond 200 kW per rack and proposes an 800 VDC
architecture [@nvidia800VDC2025], since a higher distribution voltage carries the same power at lower
current. Upgrading accelerators can therefore require rack- and facility-level power changes even
where floor space is available.

Cooling links package design to facility energy the same way. NVIDIA describes Vera Rubin as
supporting 45 °C inlet water, which can reduce chiller use in climates where outdoor air dissipates
much of the heat [@nvidiaCoolingEfficiency2026]. But for a fixed thermal resistance between chip and
coolant, warmer water leaves less temperature margin below the operating limit — so sustaining
higher activity needs either better heat transfer or colder coolant.

Power demand also fluctuates within a job. Synchronized training alternates compute-intensive and
communication-intensive phases, producing coordinated power swings across many GPUs [@choukse2025power].
Short-term storage can buffer these but has finite capacity, and throttling trades peak demand for
slower progress. Two workloads with the same average power can therefore place very different
demands on electrical infrastructure, depending on the size, timing and synchronization of their
peaks.

At the largest scale, provisioning becomes campus-level. Meta planned roughly 350,000 NVIDIA H100
GPUs by the end of 2024 and about 600,000 H100-equivalents including other
models [@reuters_meta_ai_chip_arsenal_2024]; xAI brought online a 100,000-GPU Hopper
cluster [@nvidia_xai_colossus_2024]; Oracle announced superclusters scaling to 131,072 B200
GPUs [@oracle_supercluster_2024]. Planning at that size needs dedicated substations, expanded
transmission and long-term power purchase agreements, and sometimes on-site generation — so power
availability and grid interconnection timelines are now binding constraints on deployment. Google
paired datacenter expansion with hydropower procurement at up to gigawatt
scale [@cnbc_google_pjm_2025,reuters_google_hydropower_2025]; Meta signed a 20-year agreement tied to
the 1.1 GW Clinton Clean Energy Center [@meta_constellation_2025,reuters_meta_nuclear_2025]; and
Amazon, Google and Microsoft have all pursued nuclear-linked procurement including small modular
reactor partnerships [@trellis_go_nuclear_2025].

### 4.29 Future Design Challenges: Generality versus Specialization

<sub>Sources: Survey §6.1–§6.5.</sub>

Designing a future AI datacenter is not just a matter of scaling today's accelerators, networks and
racks. Every specialized architecture embodies assumptions about what workloads will look like and
what they will demand of compute, memory and communication. Algorithms and hardware co-evolve —
emerging models change the demands, and new hardware makes previously impractical algorithms
economical — but they evolve on **different timescales**. Software and workloads shift during a
deployment's lifetime, while architectural decisions stay fixed for far longer. Five challenges
follow from that mismatch.

**Workload specialization versus fleet flexibility.** The workload mix can change while installed
capacity stays the same. Pre-training holds optimizer state and issues large collectives; online
inference is shaped by latency and throughput targets [@duan2024training,li2024llminfer]. Inference
is not one profile either: mixture-of-experts models, multimodal inputs, long contexts, retrieval
augmentation and diffusion all demand different balances of compute, memory capacity, bandwidth and
communication [@ma2026inferencehardware]. The variation appears inside a single request — prefill
offers more parallel work while decode spends more time moving weights and KV cache, and
speculative decoding, batching, prefix caching, prefill–decode disaggregation, quantization and
context length all shift the balance further. Google positions TPU 8t and TPU 8i for different
workload mixes at the pool level [@tpuv8], and OpenAI describes Jalapeño as specialized for
inference yet balanced across a changing prefill/decode mix [@openaiJalapeno2026]. Separate pools
improve efficiency but create a matching problem: one pool can sit idle while another queues.

**Data placement and movement.** Small-batch decoding can spend much of its time reading weights and
KV cache [@ma2026inferencehardware]. Moving data closer to compute reduces transfers, but nearby
capacity is limited and placement often needs explicit software management. Groq and Cerebras keep
data in on-chip SRAM, with Cerebras extending it across a wafer [@Groq2020TSP,cerebras2023], which
avoids repeated device-DRAM traffic until parameter size, context length or concurrency exhausts the
SRAM. Offloading adds transfers; distributing computation adds network communication. Under tensor
parallelism weight shards stay put, but activations and partial results must still be exchanged.
Processing-in-memory computes where operands live — d-Matrix Corsair inside SRAM
arrays [@dMatrixcorsair], Samsung HBM-PIM and SK hynix AiM inside DRAM
devices [@Samsungaquabolt,AiMJSSCC] — offering high internal bandwidth, though SRAM designs are
capacity-limited and DRAM designs throughput-limited. Processing-near-memory puts arithmetic in
adjacent logic, and 3D stacking shortens the link further: Raptor bonds logic directly to 3D DRAM to
shrink the memory interface [@nair2026raptor], gaining short paths without sacrificing throughput but
introducing thermal and reliability challenges.

**Communication across scale-up and scale-out.** Constraints come from the interaction of workload
mapping with physical design. Large gradient exchanges benefit from more link bandwidth because
payload transfer dominates; tensor-parallel decoding with small batches instead exchanges short
messages repeatedly at every layer and token [@ma2026inferencehardware]. Faster links shorten
transmission but do not remove the cost of starting an exchange, traversing the network, or waiting
on other devices — so the same fabric hits different limits as workload and batch size change.
Topology helps partly: Trainium moves from torus to switched fabrics to cut path length and
contention [@AWSTrainuim3], and Boardfly cuts TPU 8i's worst-case path across ~1K chips from 16 hops
to 7 [@tpuv8] — but that is network diameter, and the effect on any collective still depends on its
schedule and placement. Expanding a scale-up domain keeps more exchanges on the fast fabric at the
cost of longer links; copper serves short reach and optics longer, and co-packaged optics shorten the
electrical path between switch and optical interface without removing propagation delay or
synchronization [@nvidiaCPO2025].

**Power delivery and cooling from rack to facility.** These can limit how much installed capacity is
actually usable, as §4.28 works through in detail: adequate total power does not guarantee that each
rack can receive it or dissipate the resulting heat.

**Architectural specialization and model evolution.** Architectures differ in how much of a model's
computation is fixed in silicon versus left programmable, and that determines which model updates
can be absorbed in software. SambaNova's SN40L compiler maps supported graphs onto configurable
tiles and programs the routes, giving flexibility within a finite set of physical resources and
supported operations [@ISCA2024sambanova]. Taalas HC1 goes the other way, hard-wiring the model while
keeping configurable context lengths and low-rank adapters for fine-tuning [@taalas2026ubiquitous]:
updating an adapter changes behaviour, but replacing the hard-wired base model requires new silicon.
Such chips can serve their original model as long as demand lasts, yet their capacity is hard to
repurpose if demand moves to an unsupported model. Encoding model-specific function in hardware
simplifies execution while making reuse depend on what stayed programmable. Across all these cases
software can reassign work, remap computation or constrain activity — but the cost and effectiveness
of those adaptations are set by the physical resources already deployed.
